# üöÄ Smart Contract Deployment Guide (Remix IDE)

Since Hardhat is having dependency conflicts, let's use Remix IDE for deployment - it's easier and more reliable!

## Step 1: Open Remix IDE

1. **Go to**: https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. **Wait for it to load** completely

## Step 2: Create the Contract File

1. **Click "File Explorer"** (folder icon) in the left panel
2. **Right-click on "contracts"** folder ‚Üí **"New File"**
3. **Name it**: `ProjectFunding.sol`
4. **Copy and paste** the entire contract code from `c:\Users\adiin\OneDrive\Desktop\projectforge\contracts\ProjectFunding.sol`

## Step 3: Compile the Contract

1. **Click "Solidity Compiler"** (second icon in left panel)
2. **Select compiler version**: `0.8.28`
3. **Click "Compile ProjectFunding.sol"**
4. **Wait for green checkmark** ‚úÖ

## Step 4: Deploy to Sepolia

1. **Click "Deploy & Run Transactions"** (third icon)
2. **Environment**: Select **"Injected Provider - MetaMask"**
3. **MetaMask will pop up** ‚Üí Connect your account
4. **Make sure you're on Sepolia network** in MetaMask
5. **Contract**: Select **"ProjectFunding"**
6. **Click "Deploy"**
7. **MetaMask will ask for confirmation** ‚Üí Click "Confirm"
8. **Wait for deployment** (30-60 seconds)

## Step 5: Get Contract Address

1. **After deployment**, look in the "Deployed Contracts" section
2. **Copy the contract address** (starts with 0x...)
3. **Save this address** - you'll need it for the .env file

## Step 6: Update .env File

Replace `CONTRACT_ADDRESS_AFTER_DEPLOYMENT` in your .env file with the actual deployed address:

```env
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
```

## Step 7: Verify Contract (Optional)

1. **Go to**: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/
2. **Search for your contract address**
3. **Click "Contract"** tab ‚Üí **"Verify and Publish"**
4. **Follow the verification steps**
